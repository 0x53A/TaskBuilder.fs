## About

This is a single-file project that implements a [computation
expression](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/fsharp/language-reference/computation-expressions)
for writing `Task`s in F#.

F# comes with its own `Async` type and functions to convert back and forth between `Async` and `Task`, but this is a bit of a hassle -- especially since now that `Task` has language-level support in C# and VB.NET, it's the de facto standard for asynchrony on .NET. Additionally, F#'s `Async` behaves a little differently from `Task`, which can be confusing if you're used to the latter.

The goal of this computation expression builder is to let you write
asynchronous blocks that behave just like `async` methods in C# do.

For example, this F# method:

```fsharp
type X() =
  static member WriteFile() =
    task {
      do! Console.Out.WriteLineAsync("Enter a filename:")
      let! name = Console.In.ReadLineAsync()
      use file = File.CreateText(name)
      for i in Enumerable.Range(0, 100) do
        do! file.WriteLineAsync(String.Format("hello {0}", i))
      do! Console.Out.WriteLineAsync("Done")
      return name
    }
```

Should work exactly the same as this C# method:

```csharp
class X
{
  public static async Task<string> WriteFile()
  {
    await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync("Enter a filename:");
    var name = await Console.In.ReadLineAsync();
    using (var file = File.CreateText(name))
    {
      foreach (var i in Enumerable.Range(0, 100))
      {
        await file.WriteLineAsync(String.Format("hello {0}", i));
      }
    }
    await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync("Done");
    return name;
  }
}
```

In practice there is a small performance hit compared to the C# version, because the C# compiler compiles each
`async` method to a specialized state machine class, while `TaskBuilder` uses a general-purpose
state machine and must chain together continuation functions to represent the computation.
However, `TaskBuilder` should still be faster than using `Task.ContinueWith` or `Async.StartAsTask`.

## Usage

This is public domain code. I encourage you to simply copy
TaskBuilder.fs into your own project and use it as you see fit.

The other files are unit tests which you do not need to copy (but
again, you are free to do so).
